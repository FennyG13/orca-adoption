    <p>
      The Orca, also known as Killer Whale, is a toothed whale that is the largest member of the dolphins family. They
      are one of the most recognizable marine mammals, with their distinctive black and white bodies. Found in every
      ocean in the world, the species has the most varied diet of all cetaceans. Scientists now recognizes several
      different kinds of orcas called <span class="ecotypes">Ecotypes</span>. They specialized in their foraging
      behavior, diet, and live in different parts of the world. Orcas often use a coordinated hunting strategy. Working
      as a team like a pack of wolves, earning them the nickname of "<b>The Wolves of the Sea</b>".
